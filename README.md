Hi!

The utility of this bot is to blacklist toxic people from ur group/groups.

When a person is blacklisted and try to join in your group, will be banned for 1 week. (i have set 1 week if u unblock him, else permamently banned.)

Commands:
/block @username - Add a person in blacklist.
/unblock @username - Remove a person from blacklist.

Is required pyrogram (https://docs.pyrogram.org/intro/install)
and python 3.

If u need any help, contact me on Telegram: @UsernameUsermoso
